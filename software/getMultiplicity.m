% [r, udata, sdata] = getMultiplicity(data) returns the occurrences/Multiplicity of the elements of 'data'
%
% Inputs:
%         data : n-dimensional input array
%
% Outputs: 
%          rep : # of occurrences for each element of 'data'
%        udata : sorted 1-D array of unique values in 'data'
%        sdata : sorted 1-D array of values in 'data'
%
% Note: NaN/Inf elements in input data are ignored
