%getMovieObjectAndProcess Get the MovieObject and indicated Process
%instance
%
% INPUT
% movieObjectOrProcess:      Either a MovieObject instance or a Process instance
% processClass:              String, Process, or meta.class indicating
%                             the class of the Process we are looking for
% createProcessIfNoneExists: logical indicating whether to create the process if it
%                             does not exist (optional, default: false)
% Extra arguments will be passed to the constructor if creating a new
% process
%
% OUTPUT
% movieObject: MovieObject handle that owns the Process
% process: Process handle of type processClass, empty if it does not exist
%          and createProcess is false
% processID: index value of the Process in movieObject
%
