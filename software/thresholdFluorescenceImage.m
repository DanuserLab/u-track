% 
% This function selects a threshold for the input fluorescence image by
% analyzing the image's intensity distribution. This requires good signal-
% to-noise, and a significant amount of background in the image. The
% threshold is selected by first finding the lowest intensity maximum in the
% image histogram (the background). Then the first minimum in the histogram
% of higher intensity than this peak is selected as the threshold.
% 
% Input:
% 
%   imageIn - The N-Dimensional image to be thresholded.
% 
% 
%   showPlots - If true, a plot of the histogram and an overlay of the mask
%   on the image will be shown. The overlay plot only works if the image is
%   2D.
%   
%   noisy = 0/1. If 1 the drop from the first maximum to the first minimum
%                must exceed the MAD of the difference between
%                the extrema values. Otherwise the first maximum/minimum
%                pair is rejected and the next is considered. This is only
%                a reasonable constraint if the spline fit yields many
%                extrema (bumpy spline) and needs to be smoothed (at least
%                10 max and min respectively). 
%                
% 
% Output:
% 
% 
%   thresholdValue - The intensity value selected for thresholding.
