function [ S , cached] = load( filename, varargin )
% function [ S , cached] = cached.load( filename, '-cacheFlag', '-loadFlag', variables )
%cached.load Emulates the built-in load but adds a caching facility so that
%subsequent loads read from memory rather than disk
%
% cached.load resolves the location of the MAT file indicated by filename
% and stores the contents in memory. The next request to load that MAT file
% is loaded from memory rather than the disk. 
%
% If any variables are indicated, then the cache is checked for those
% variables and loaded if necessary. This is highly recommended to
% ensure the needed variables are loaded.
%
% If all variables contained in the file are needed and variables are not
% listed, it is recommended that the -reset flag is used to ensure all
% variables are loaded at least once. Otherwise, only the previously
% requested variables may be returned. While this will not cache the
% current loading operation, it may assist subsequent loads.
%
% This function is faster if filename is an absolute path.
%
% Usage
% -----
% S = cached.load( ____ );
%     Just like the built-in load, caches the output
% S = cached.load(filename, '-reset', ____ )
%     resets the cache for filename
% S = cached.load(filename, '-useCache', false , ____ )
%     resets the cache for filename
% S = cached.load(filename, '-useCache', true , ____ )
%     same as cached.load(filename, _____)
% cached.load('-clear') 
%     clears the entire cache
%
% See also load
% 
% Output
% ------
% S is the structure output by load or empty
% cached is a logical flag indicating if the cached was used

% 3. If cache is invalid, then load the file
% 4. Remove variables in the matfile that were not requested
% 5. If no output is requested, assign values in the caller like load

if(~isempty(variables))

    S = struct();
    for f = 1:length(variables)
        S.(variables{f}) = bigS.(variables{f});

if(nargout == 0)
    % if we loaded in ascii mode, then S may not be a struct
    if(isstruct(S))
        S_fields = fieldnames(S);

    function setData(key,S,all_variables,last_modified,bytes)
        record.data = S;
        record.all_variables = all_variables;
        record.last_modified = last_modified;
