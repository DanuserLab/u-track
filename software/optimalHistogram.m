function [N,X,sp] = optimalHistogram(varargin)
% OPTIMALHISTOGRAM generates a histogram using the "optimal" number of bins
%
% This function was previously called histogram prior to R2014B
%
% If called with no output argument, optimalHistogram plots into the current axes
%
% SYNOPSIS [N,X,sp] = optimalHistogram(data,factor,normalize)
%          [...] = optimalHistogram(data,'smooth')
%          [...] = optimalHistogram(axesHandle,...)
%
% INPUT    data: vector of input data
%          factor: (opt) factor by which the bin-widths are multiplied
%                   if 'smooth' (or 's'), a smooth histogram will be formed.
%                   (requires the spline toolbox). For an alternative
%                   approach to a smooth histogram, see ksdensity.m
%                   if 'discrete' (or 'd'), the data is assumed to be a discrete
%                   collection of values. Note that if every data point is,
%                   on average, repeated at least 3 times, histogram will
%                   consider it a discrete distribution automatically.
%                   if 'continuous' (or 'c'), histogram is not automatically
%                   checking for discreteness.
%          normalize : if 1 (default), integral of histogram equals number
%                       data points. If 0, height of bins equals counts.
%                       This option is exclusive to non-"smooth" histograms
%          axesHandle: (opt) if given, histogram will be plotted into these
%                       axes, even if output arguments are requested
%
% OUTPUT   N   : number of points per bin (value of spline)
%          X   : center position of bins (sorted input data)
%          sp  : definition of the smooth spline
%
% REMARKS: The smooth histogram is formed by calculating the cumulative
%           histogram, fitting it with a smoothening spline and then taking
%           the analytical derivative. If the number of data points is
%           markedly above 1000, the spline is fitting the curve too
%           locally, so that the derivative can have huge peaks. Therefore,
%           only 1000-1999 points are used for estimation.
%           Note that the integral of the spline is almost exactly the
%           total number of data points. For a standard histogram, the sum
%           of the hights of the bins (but not their integral) equals the
%           total number of data points. Therefore, the counts might seem
%           off.
%
%           WARNING: If there are multiples of the minimum value, the
%           smooth histogram might get very steep at the beginning and
%           produce an unwanted peak. In such a case, remove the
%           multiple small values first (for example, using isApproxEqual)
