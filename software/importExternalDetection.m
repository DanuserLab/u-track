function importExternalDetection(movieData,varargin)
% importExternalDetection imports external detection results into the movie infrastructure
%
% This function copies all the folders defined by the InputData field of
% the input parameters under a folder and registers this output in the
% external process.
%
%     importExternalDetection(movieData) runs the external detection
%     process on the input movie
%
%     importExternalDetection(movieData, paramsIn) additionally takes
%     the input parameters
%
%     paramsIn should be a structure with inputs for optional parameters.
%     The parameters should be stored as fields in the structure, with the
%     field names and possible values as described below
%
%   Possible Parameter Structure Field Names:
%       ('FieldName' -> possible values)
%
%       ('OutputDirectory' -> character string)
