function MLpackList = inputMLPackageList()
    % inputMLPackageList - Returns a list of available packages using 
    % MovieList as input instead of MovieData.
    %
    % Purpose:
    % This function is designed to handle packages that use MovieList (ML) 
    % as input. It addresses issues related to path display, switching 
    % between MovieLists, and managing multiple MovieLists on the packageGUI 
    % and setting GUIs. 
    % The function is called in five different functions below
    % to handle ML-based input packages, so in the future, instead of 
    % editing each of these five functions, you can simply add new ML input 
    % packages to inputMLPackageList as needed.
    %
    % It is used in below functions:
    %   - packageGUI.m: 
    %       (1) Fixed the error when switching between MovieLists on packageGUI.
    %       (2) Enabled the Folder Icon (pushbutton_open) to call another GUI, 
    %           named folderViewer, for opening multiple result folders.
    %
    %   - packageGUI_RefreshFcn.m: 
    %       Solved the issue of MovieLists' paths not being correctly displayed 
    %       on the packageGUI.
    %
    %   - packageGUI_RunFcn.m: 
    %       Fixed the issue packageGUI cannot handle multiple MLs
    %
    %   - processGUI_OpeningFcn.m: 
    %       Fixed the issue where, if only one MovieList is present, the 
    %       checkbox (Apply Check/Uncheck to All Movies) would remain unchecked 
    %       and invisible on PackageGUI and on all setting GUIs for the ML
    %       as input packages.
    %
    %   - userfcn_checkAllMovies.m: 
    %       Resolved the issue where the checkbox (Apply Check/Uncheck to All 
    %       Movies) was not functioning properly on packageGUI.
