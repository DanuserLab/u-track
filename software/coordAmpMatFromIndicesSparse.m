%OUTPUT
%
%REMARKS This is a quick hack, I took these lines out of the function
%"linkFeaturesKalmanSparse".

%reserve space for matrix
trackedFeatureInfo = sparse(size(trackedFeatureIndx,1),8*numFrames);
% trackedFeatureInfo = NaN(size(trackedFeatureIndx,1),8*numFrames);

%for now, the matrix always has space for z, hence I have to treat 2D and
%3D differently.
%at some point I can change the postprocessing functions to handle 2D and
%3D differently, and so I can save them differently, in which case I won't
%need the if-else here.
