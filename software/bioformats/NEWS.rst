* Nikon NIS-Elements ND2

     instead of the entire image being read and then copied
* Zeiss AxioVision ZVI (Zeiss Vision Image)
   - ensure that the ``bitsPerPixel`` field is always set to match the final
     pixel type, and populate any channel colors that were parsed in the
     metadata. The bits per pixel update should only affect ``uint16`` or 
     ``int16`` files where the acquisition bit depth is not a multiple of 8, 
     and the RGB channel count is greater than 1

Updated build system:

  version 5.4.0. This allows for improved ROI handling by enabling support for Shape 
  objects with Transform attributes. OME-XML schema version remains unchanged as 
  :model_doc:`OME schema 2016-06 <schemas/june-2016-2.html>`

     data. The pixel type will now remain unchanged as will the pixel values 
     which had previously been scaled incorrectly

   - fix for ``java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`` when using bfconvert via command line 
     with option set to only convert a single time-point, channel or Z section

     BigTIFF datasets

   - a few fixes for problems with byte alignment when reading non-core 
     metadata from NIFTI headers

* Leica LIF
   - added support for timestamps of LIF files created with LAS AF 3.1 or 
     newer. In the case of a halted acquisition only non-null timestamps are 
     stored in the OME metadata (thanks to Michael Goelzer)
   - the physical pixel height and width were incorrectly calculated by 
     dividing by the number of pixels. This has now been corrected to match 
     the official Leica LIF specification documents by dividing by the number 
     of pixels minus one (thanks to Michael Goelzer)
   - for backwards compatibility an option to preserve pre-5.3.3 physical sizes 
     has been added. This can be set either via command line tools, through 
     the API with the ``loci.formats.in.DynamicMetadataOptions`` class, or in the Bio-Formats 
     plugin configuration in ImageJ

* Improvision TIFF
   - channel colors are now being read and if present set correctly in image metadata

   - updated to read the emission wavelength and set ``EmissionWavelength`` on
     ``LightSourceSettings`` in the generated OME-XML

* QuickTime
   - fixed incorrect image data when reading of tiles from single channel files

     via client code using ``loci.formats.TiffWriter``, converting to a TIFF 
     or OME-TIFF using 'bfconvert' command line tool or exporting to TIFF or 
     OME-TIFF using ImageJ/FIJI Bio-Formats exporter.

The Data Model version 2016-06 has been released to introduce
`Folders <http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/data-model/future-plans/2016/05/23/folders-upcoming/>`_,
and to simplify both the graphical aspects of the model and code generation.
Full details are available in the
:model_doc:`OME Model and Formats Documentation <schemas/june-2016.html>`.
OME-XML changes include:

* `Map` is now a complexType rather than an element and `MapPairs` has been
  dropped
* extended enum metadata has been introduced to better support units
* `Shape` and `LightSource` are now complexTypes rather than elements
* BinData has been added to code generation to handle raw binary data
* various code generation improvements to:

   - remove a number of hard-coded exceptional cases allowing for easier
     maintenance and growth
   - allow for genuine abstract model types and enable C++ model
     implementation
* updated OME-XML and OME-TIFF public sample files

The Bio-Formats C++ native implementation has been decoupled from
the Java codebase and will be released as
`OME-Files C++ <http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/ome-files-cpp/>`_ from now
on, with the exception of OME-XML which is still within Bio-Formats at present
(there is a plan to decouple both the Java and the C++ versions of OME-XML in
