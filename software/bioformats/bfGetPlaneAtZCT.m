function [I,idx] = bfGetPlaneAtZCT( r, z, c, t, varargin )
%bfGetPlaneAtCZT Obtains an image plane for the Z, C, T
%
%   I = bfGetPlaneAtZCT(r, z, c, t) returns a specified plane from the input
%   format reader. The indices specifying the plane to retrieve should be
%   contained between 1 and the number of planes for each dimesnion.
%
%   I = bfGetPlaneAtZCT(r, z, c, t, ...) does as above but passes extra
%   arguments to bfGetPlane for tiling, etc.
%
% Examples
%
%    r = bfGetReader('example.tif');
%    I = bfGetPlaneAtZCT(r, 1, 1, 1) % First plane of the series
%    I = bfGetPlaneAtZCT(r,r.getSizeZ(),r.getSizeC(),r.getSizeT()) % Last plane of the series
%    I = bfGetPlaneAtZCT(r, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 20, 20) % 20x20 tile originated at (0, 0)
