function figHan = fsFigure(sizeFraction,varargin)
%FSFIGURE creates a figure which takes up the whole screen or a specified fraction of it
% 
% fsFigure
%
% figHan = fsFigure
% figHan = fsFigure(sizeFraction)
% figHan = fsFigure(sizeFraction,varargin)
% 
% This will create a full-screen (or smaller) figure centered on the
% default display and returns the figure handle.
% 
% Input:
% 
%     sizeFraction - Optional. Scalar or vector of length 2. The fraction
%                    of the screen dimensions to make the figure. That is,
%                    if your screen  resolution is 1024x768 and
%                    sizeFraction is 1, the figure will also be 1024x768,
%                    whereas if sizeFraction is .5, the figure will be
%                    512x384.
%                   
%                    If sizeFraction is a vector, the first elements
%                    specifies the fraction of the screen width to use, and
%                    the second element the fraction of the screen height.
%
%                    Optional. Default is 1 - that is, to make the figure
%                    the same size as the screen.
%
%    varargin -     Any additional arguments will be passed to the figure
%                   command
%                    
% Output:
% 
%     figHan - The handle to the newly created figure.
