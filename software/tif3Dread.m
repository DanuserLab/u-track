function image = tif3Dread(filename)
%TIF3DREAD uses imread to read every page in a multi-page (3D) tif
% 
% image = tif3Dread(filename)
% 
% This reads every image in the specified 3D (multi-page) .tif file and
% combines all the images into a single 3D matrix.
% 
% Input:
% 
%   filename - The name of the multi-page .tif file to read.
% 
% 
% Output:
% 
%   image - The 3D matrix containing the concatenated images.
%
% NOTE: This function is semi-redundant with stackRead.m. The only
% difference is that it supports all the compression formats used by
% imwrite.m, and stackRead.m does not. However, stackRead.m is faster so
% use that unless you are dealing with compressed multi-page .tifs which
% have been created in matlab.
