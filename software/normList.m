function [listOfNorms,normedVectors]=normList(vectors,doCheck,correctNaN)
%calculates the norm of a list of vectors
%
%SYNOPSIS [listOfNorms,normedVectors]=normList(vectors,doCheck,correctNaN)
%
%INPUT list of vectors (nVectorsXdimension)
%      noCheck (optional, true/false, default: true): normList checks for
%           old versions of Matlab that do not have bsxfun. This check is
%           slow, so if you know that you'll have Matlab 7.6 or later, set
%           doCheck to false to speed up computation. 
%      correctNaN (optional, true/false, default: true): if true, NaNs in
%           unit vectors will be set to zero (a zero-length vector will
%           lead to all NaNs since it's divided by the norm, resulting in
%           0/0).
%
%OUTPUT listOfNorms: list (nX1) containing the norms of the vectors
%       normedVectors: list (nXdim) containing the normed vectors
