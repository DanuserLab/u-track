% 
% This function selects a threshold for the input fluorescence image by
% analyzing the image's intensity distribution. This requires good signal-
% to-noise, and a significant amount of background in the image. The
% threshold is selected using Otsu's method
% 
% Input:
% 
%   imageIn - The N-Dimensional image to be thresholded.
% 
% 
%   showPlots - If true, a plot of the histogram and an overlay of the mask
%   on the image will be shown. The overlay plot only works if the image is
%   2D.
% 
% 
% Output:
% 
% 
%   level - The intensity value selected for thresholding.
%   mask (optional) -- the thresholded foreground mask is returned as 
%                      an optional output argument
