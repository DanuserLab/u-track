function fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session, ids, varargin)
% GETDATASETFILEANNOTATIONS Retrieve file annotations linked to datasets
%
%    fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session, ids) returns all file
%    annotations linked to the datasets specified by the input identifiers
%    and owned by the session user.
%
%    fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session, datasets) returns all file
%    annotations linked to the input datasets and owned by the session
%    user.
%
%    fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session,  ids, 'include', include) only
%    returns file annotations with the input namespace.
%
%    fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session,  ids, 'exclude', exclude)
%    excludes file annotations with the input namespace.
%
%    fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session, ids, 'owner', ownerid)
%    returns the file annotations owned by the user specified by ownerid.
%    Use -1 to return the file annotations owned by all users.
%
%    Examples:
%
%        fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session, ids)
%        fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session, datasets)
%        fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session, ids, 'include', include)
%        fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session, ids, 'exclude', exclude)
%        fas = getDatasetFileAnnotations(session, ids, 'owner', -1)
