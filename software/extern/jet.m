%JET  Variant of HSV colormap
%
% Examples:
%   map = jet;
%   map = jet(len);
%   B = jet(A);
%   B = jet(A, lims);
%
% Similar to MATLAB's jet function, but also able to return a concise
% colormap table.
%
% The function can additionally be used to convert a real-valued array into
% a truecolor array using the colormap.
%
% IN:
%   len - Scalar length of the output colormap. If len == Inf the concise
%         table is returned. Default: len = size(get(gcf, 'Colormap'), 1);
%   A - Non-scalar numeric array of real values to be converted into
%       truecolor.
%   lims - 1x2 array of saturation limits to be used on A. Default:
%          [min(A(:)) max(A(:))].
%
% OUT:
%   map - (len)xJ colormap table. J = 3, except in the concise case, when
%         J = 4, map(1:end-1,4) giving the relative sizes of the 
%         inter-color bins.
%   B - size(A)x3 truecolor array.
