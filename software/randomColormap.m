function cMap = randomColormap(n,seed,otherColormap)
%RANDOMCOLORMAP produes a random colormap which does not contain grays/white/black
%
% colorMap = randomColormap
% colorMap = randomColormap(n)
% colorMap = randomColormap(n,seed)
% colorMap = randomColormap(n,seed,otherColormap)
%
% Produces a colormap (an nx3 matrix containing RGB values) for a specified
% number of colors. The colors are of random hue, but always always of
% saturation=1 and value=1 so there are no grays or white or black. By
% specifying an integer seed for the random number generation you can make
% sure you always get the same colormap.
%
% Random permutations of other colormaps are possible by giving a 3rd
% parameter. Another colormap may be a Nx3 matrix or a string for a
% colormap function such as 'jet' or 'hsv'. In the case of 'hsv', the
% distribution of hues will be even, which may not be the case with two
% parameters. A scalar saturation value may also specified.
%   
% Input:
%
%   n - number of colors in colormap
%
%   seed - non-negative integer specifying the seed to use for random
%   number generation. Specify to obtain the same colormap each time,
%   otherwise it will be randombly generated each time (the random number
%   generator will be shuffled, but then returned to the state it was in
%   prior to generating the colormap so other processes will not be
%   affected)
%
%   otherColormap - other colormap to use specified as a string, function
%   handle, a nx3 matrix, or a scalar saturation value.
%
% Output:
%
% colorMap - an nx3 RGB colormap
