function ImDpackList = inputImDPackageList()
    % inputImDPackageList - Returns a list of available packages using 
    % ImageData as input instead of MovieData or MovieList.
    %
    % Purpose:
    % This function is designed to handle packages that use ImageData (ImD) 
    % as input. It addresses issues related to switching between multiple 
    % ImDs and displaying their paths on the packageGUI. 
    % 
    % The function is called in the function below to handle ImD-based 
    % input packages. In the future, instead of editing each function individually, 
    % simply add new ImD input packages to inputImDPackageList as needed.
    %
    % It is used in the following function:
    %
    %   - packageGUI_RefreshFcn.m: 
    %       Solved the issue of ImageData paths not being correctly displayed 
    %       on the packageGUI.
