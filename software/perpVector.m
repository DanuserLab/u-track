function [v_perp v_proj]=perpVector(point1,e_1,point2)
%finds the perpendicular vector v connecting the straight line defined by
%point1 and e_1 with point2
%
%SYNOPSIS v_perp=perpVector(point1,e_1,point2)
%
%INPUT point1, e_1 : point and UNIT vector defining the straight line
%      point2: point from which the new perpendicular vector should start
%      (all inputs can be lists of n-by-d, where d is the dimension)
%
%OUTPUT v_perp perpendicular vector from the straight line to the point
%           (norm(v_perp)=distance of the point from the line)
